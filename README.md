# Ecommerce (Go)

This repository contains a simple ecommerce backend written in Go. It provides basic user, product, and cart types, controllers, and database connection scaffolding to be used as a starting point for small projects or learning purposes.

**Status**: Minimal backend scaffold — ready for local development and extension.

**Contents**
- **Overview**: Short description and goals.
- **Requirements**: Tools required to build and run the project.
- **Setup & Run**: How to build, run, and test locally.
- **Project Structure**: Map of the repo and purpose of important files.
- **API / Routes**: Quick reference to controllers and endpoints.

**Overview**

This project implements a lightweight REST-style backend with the following responsibilities:
- User management (basic user model and controller).
- Product listing and management.
- Cart types and basic operations (types only; extend controllers as needed).

Use this as a starting point to add authentication, persistence, and business logic.

**Requirements**
- **Go**: version 1.18+ recommended. Verify with `go version`.
- A working `make` utility if you plan to use the `Makefile`.

**Quick Setup**

1. Clone the repo (if not already):

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ecommerce
```

2. Build the binary:

```bash
go build .
```

3. Run using `go run` (no build step required):

```bash
go run .
```

4. Or run the produced binary (binary name depends on your directory; likely `ecommerce`):

```bash
./ecommerce
```

5. If you prefer `Makefile` targets:

```bash
make all
```

**Environment**

The project may use configuration or environment variables for database connections and other services. Inspect `database/connection.go` and `helper/sendemail.go` to see required variables and how they are loaded. Example variables you might set:

```bash
export DB_HOST=localhost
export DB_PORT=5432
export DB_USER=myuser
export DB_PASS=mypass
export DB_NAME=ecommercedb
```

Adjust as required by your environment and the code in `database/connection.go`.

**Project Structure**

- `main.go`: Application entrypoint and server initialization.
- `go.mod`: Go module file.
- `Makefile`: Convenience commands for building/running.
- `auth/`:
	- `auth.go`: Authentication helpers/middleware.
- `constant/`:
	- `constant.go`: Project constants.
- `controller/`:
	- `healthCheckController.go`: Health check endpoint.
	- `productController.go`: Product-related handlers.
	- `userController.go`: User-related handlers.
- `database/`:
	- `connection.go`: DB connection setup.
	- `dbcalls.go`: Data access functions (DB queries).
- `helper/`:
	- `helper.go`: Utility helpers used across the project.
	- `sendemail.go`: Email helper utilities.
- `router/`:
	- `router.go`, `routes.go`: HTTP router and route registration.
- `types/`:
	- `cart-type.go`, `product-type.go`, `user-type.go`: Core domain types.

**API / Routes (Quick Reference)**

Inspect `router/routes.go` and `controller/` files for the current endpoints. Typical endpoints you will find or add include:
- `GET /health` — health check
- `GET /products` — list products
- `GET /products/:id` — product details
- `POST /users` — create user
- `POST /auth` — login / token (if implemented)

Add or extend routes in `router/routes.go` and implement handler logic in `controller/`.

**Database**

Open `database/connection.go` to see the database driver and connection string format used. If the project uses migrations, add them and run with your preferred migration tool.

**Testing**

There are no tests included by default. To add tests, create `_test.go` files next to the package under test and run:

```bash
go test ./...
```

**Contributing**

Contributions are welcome. Suggested workflow:

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Add tests for new behavior.
3. Open a pull request describing the change.

**License**

This project does not include a license file by default. Add a `LICENSE` file if you plan to make the project public and specify licensing terms.

**Contact / Help**

If you want help expanding this project (authentication, persistence, tests, Docker, CI), tell me which feature to add and I can scaffold it.
